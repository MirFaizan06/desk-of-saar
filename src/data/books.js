    priceINR: 0,
    description: "A novel of magical realism set in a mystical 'Studio at World's Edge', a transcendent space where souls go after death to have the metaphorical cracks in their hearts mended with gold, a process inspired by the Japanese art of Kintsugi. The story follows Noroi, a young man who died from the weight of unrequited love, as he learns to accept his emotional fractures in order to 'cross over'. The narrative serves as a philosophical exploration of grief, self-acceptance, and finding beauty and purpose in one's broken history.",
